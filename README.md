The m2tklib GUI library is designed and created by olikraus (http://code.google.com/p/m2tklib/) and 
is mirrored on GitHub by punklibrarian.
 
**Note: I have nothing to do with the development of m2tklib and do not know olikraus, I just like m2tklib and wish to
tinker and happen to use GitHub over Google Code.**
